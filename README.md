How publiching to GitHub Packages works

To publish to GitHub Packages I've used [GitHub template](https://github.com/jurijsk/dummy/actions/new?category=continuous-integration&query=Publish+Node.js+Package+to+GitHub+Packages) with a couple of change, which include:
 * Changed default befaviour to only publish on `relese: types: [created]` (see lines:6-8) to publich on every commit.
 * Added git config calls to set `user.name` and `user.email` to avoid errors from git
 * Added `- run: npm version patch` (line:36) to automatically increment patch number (x.x.++)
 * Removed `- run: npm test` (around line ~20) cos i do not have any tests.

Notes:
 * No tokens stored anywhere in the repo, the workflow relies on `GITHUB_TOKEN` with is autogenerated and it has access to the repo and can do anything it needs to publish.
 * Note that `.npmrc` is not present as all the details needed for publish on commit are stated in `yml` itself.
 * To consume the package one might need to name the `.npmrc` file with `@jurijsk:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/` and pass the token to `npm install`
