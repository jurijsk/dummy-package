This repo will contain nothing expect readme and some other BS just to text checkout with PET. Novel idea huh. 


v1.0.1
	- nothing new just a test for Github Action to publish new version of the package

v1.0.2 
	- Adding package.lock with no packages to make `npm ci` shut up
	- removing unscoped `repository` from `.npmrc` to make instalations from public repost possible
	- send it
v1.0.3
	- Getting rid of `      - run: npm test` is the GitHub Actions workflow
